# NederLang 

NederLang is an interpreted programming language where all keywords are Dutch words. It is dynamically typed and inspired by the likes of JavaScript, Python and C.

Here's a sample program in NederLang:

```
stel a = "Wilhelmus van Nassouwe"
stel b = a.splits(" ")

voorelk woord in b {
    print woord + ","
}
```
